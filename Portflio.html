    <h1><a id="portfolio-Peony-text">Peony Garden </a></h1>
    <p>Peony Garden is an app designed to teach users how to grow plants through an immersive gardening simulation.  Our app utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to allow users to create and nurture virtual plants within their environment. Users can purchase and plant seeds, manipulate environmental settings such as daily sunlight hours, temperature, and moisture, and water the plants. </p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to successfully care for each plant, requiring users to adjust environmental settings to provide the appropriate amount of sunlight, moisture, and temperature for optimal growth. We aim to offer an educational experience by providing users with detailed information and care instructions for each plant.</p>
    <p>By creating an accessible, immersive, and educational app for users to virtually grow plants, we aspire to empower individuals of all ages and abilities to discover the joys of gardening.</p>

    <h1><a id="portfolio-mentors-text">Mentors For Higher Education</a></h1>
    <p>As a first-generation student, the college application process was daunting and difficult, yet the best thing I have ever done. Because of UMass, I have been able to take advantage of incredible opportunities to grow both academically and professionally. Motivated by my journey, I wanted to inspire students facing similar circumstances and founded Mentors For Higher Education.</p>

    <p>MFHE is a volunteer program that partners college students with first-generation high school students to help them apply to college. We work both remotely and in person to provide personilized mentorship. By helping to share resources and guidance to research colleges, understand the finances, review college essays, ask for recommendation letters, and submit applications.</p>

<div class="portfolio-Chatbot-text">
    <h1><a id="portfolio-chatbot-text">UMass Wellness Resource Chatbot</a></h1>
    <p>The UMass Wellness Resource chatbot (created through ChatGPT's API) is an artificial intelligence chatbot that helps recommend students wellness resources based on their inquiries. We trained it on resources from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/counseling/">UMass Center for Counseling and Psychological Health</a>.</p>
   
    <p>The idea was first inspired from the <a href="Portflio.html#portfolio-UKG-text">Employee Wellness Hub</a> I developed during a hackathon at my 2023 summer internship at <a href="https://www.ukg.com/">UKG</a>. I continued the project at UMass, pivoting to a Student Wellness Hub to enable students like her to track health and take surveys for recommended wellness resources.</p>
    
    <p>Pitching this idea at the UMass Minute Pitch Competition  led to an invitation to join the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/icorps/innovators-jump-start">UMass I-Corps Jump-Start Program</a>. Through their training program and mentorship, I researched wellness needs for students, faculty, and the UMass Center for Counseling and Psychological Health (CCPH). Interviews revealed students' difficulties in finding resources, a desire among professors for better recommendations, and an overall frustration in CCPH's poor resource allocation.</p>

    <p>To address these issues, I proposed an AI chatbot, trained on information about the UMass wellness resources to streamline resource access and recommendations. In December 2023 I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7137493263405453312/">recruited</a> 11 umass software developers to train the AI and build an MVP. Unfortunately we have not been able to publish it because of the copyright laws on information from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/counseling/">CCPH</a> website.</p>

                <p>The UKG wellness hub was first developed during <a href="https://www.ukg.com/">UKG</a>'s 2023 Summer Hackathon. We created a tool to help employees track their daily wellness and receive suggested actions for improvement. I receievd so much support from my team and was suggested to bring the product to a stakeholder review.</p>
                <p>In the following two weeks, I dove into researching various aspects including the cost implications of poor employee wellness, the advantages of the Employee Wellness Hub, current investment patterns in employee wellness, and the strategies adopted by our competitors for employee wellness management. I conducted an in-house survey involving 52 employees at UKG to gauge the potential success of the product and prioritize its features. I then developed the design on Figma, wrote out requirements, aligned its objectives with <a href="https://www.ukg.com/solutions/wellbeing-at-work">UKG's Values</a>, assessed its potential impact on our clients, and proposed future enhancements to the product.</p>
                <p>This product fueled my passion to for wellness technology and inspired my development of the <a href="Portflio.html#portfolio-chatbot-text">UMass Wellness Resource Chatbot</a>.</p>
