    <h1><a id="portfolio-Peony-text">Peony Garden </a></h1>
    <p>Peony Garden is an app designed to teach users how to grow plants through an immersive gardening simulation.  Our app utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to allow users to create and nurture virtual plants within their environment. Users can purchase and plant seeds, manipulate environmental settings such as daily sunlight hours, temperature, and moisture, and water the plants. </p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to successfully care for each plant, requiring users to adjust environmental settings to provide the appropriate amount of sunlight, moisture, and temperature for optimal growth. We aim to offer an educational experience by providing users with detailed information and care instructions for each plant.</p>
    <p>By creating an accessible, immersive, and educational app for users to virtually grow plants, we aspire to empower individuals of all ages and abilities to discover the joys of gardening.</p>

    <h1><a id="portfolio-mentors-text">Mentors For Higher Education</a></h1>
    <p>As a first-generation student, the college application process was difficult to do by myself, but looking back on it, the best thing I have ever done. 
        Because of UMass Amherst, I have been given so many opporunities to find my interests and grow academically and professionally. The summer after my sophmore year 
        I felt determined to help other first-generation stuents apply to college, and started Mentors for Higher Education. 
    </p>
    <p> I put out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kurstin-burnham_i-am-excited-to-share-with-you-a-new-volunteer-activity-6988606862141063168-XwFh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"> MFHE fylers</a> online and around school to recruit students.</p>
    <p> My Junior year, I brought UMass Amherst student mentors to Amherst High School once a week to help student apply to college. 
        For Senior year, I decided to make the program remote to reach more low-income students across Massachusetts and have more flexibility for Mentors. </p>

    <h1><a id="portfolio-chatbot-text">UMass Wellness Resource Chatbot</a></h1>
    <p>The UMass Wellness Resource chatbot (created through ChatGPT's API) is an artificial intelligence chatbot that helps recommend students wellness resources based on their inquiries. We trained it on resources from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/counseling/">UMass Center for Counseling and Psychological Health</a>.</p>
   
    <p>The idea was first inspired from the <a href="Portflio.html#portfolio-UKG-text">Employee Wellness Hub</a> I developed during a hackathon at my 2023 summer internship at <a href="https://www.ukg.com/">UKG</a>. I continued the project at UMass, pivoting to a Student Wellness Hub to enable students like her to track health and take surveys for recommended wellness resources.</p>
    
    <p>Pitching this idea at the UMass Minute Pitch Competition  led to an invitation to join the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/icorps/innovators-jump-start">UMass I-Corps Jump-Start Program</a>. Through their training program and mentorship, I researched wellness needs for students, faculty, and the UMass Center for Counseling and Psychological Health (CCPH). Interviews revealed students' difficulties in finding resources, a desire among professors for better recommendations, and an overall frustration in CCPH's poor resource allocation.</p>

    <p>To address these issues, I proposed an AI chatbot, trained on information about the UMass wellness resources to streamline resource access and recommendations. In December 2023 I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7137493263405453312/">recruited</a> 11 umass software developers to train the AI and build an MVP. Unfortunately we have not been able to publish it because of the copyright laws on information from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/counseling/">CCPH</a> website.</p>

                <p>Our mission is to combat the textile waste crisis by increasing the lifespan of clothing.
